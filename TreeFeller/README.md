## Plugin Details

This plugin will naively destroy a tree when it's bottom log is broken with a wooden axe. This is a very early version which is likely to clobber any and all surrounding trees. It also will not work correctly on trees with extra branches (not vertically connected to the main trunk) or 2x2 trees.\
Use with care, as this will destroy any pillar of logs that you set it loose on.
