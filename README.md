## About `minecraft-plugins`

This is a collection of Minecraft plugins that I've written to add quality-of-life features or to experiment.

## Plugins included

- `PowerfulMobs`: Increases the difficulty by replacing certain mobs with harder-to-kill counterparts
- `FallingBlocks`: Makes blocks within a customisable distance of the player(s) be affected by gravity (not recommended for serious survival play)
- `FallingBlocksNoise`: Implements the same functionality as `FallingBlocks`, but uses perlin noise to decide the depth and elevation at which to apply gravity (more lightweight than `FallingBlocks` and more realistic)

## Plugins yet to be uploaded

- `FallingBlocksAsync`: Implements the same functionality as `FallingBlocks`, but tries to offload some of the work onto another thread to improve performance
- `Manhunt`: Simple implementation of the plugin used by YouTuber `Dream` in his Minecraft manhunt videos
- `BetterCompass`: Allows players to make their compass point to a location or player of their choice
- `AntiPVP`: Discourages PvP in an unconventional way
- `MinecraftSudoku`: Allows the player to play sudoku in Minecraft (checker and solver included)
- `AntiRain`: Stops it from raining on the server

## Plugins in progress

- `AutoSleep`: Allows one player to sleep on behalf of all the other players
- `HealthDisplay`: Shows the player's current health above their head
